At the age of 39, I decided to learn programming more seriously than I had done before. GPT Chat helps me with this and a persistent feeling that I miss how to breathe. The story is long, contradictory and ambiguous. 

In June 2024, I returned to laptop repair again to support my body with food. Now I have a lot of ideas and a desire to program everything in the world. 

I do not know how my life will turn out in the future, but I hope that I will have time to do something useful and interesting, let's go..
